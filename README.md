# Summary

This is a simple utility used for generating self-signed certificates.  It is meant to 
be used for development purposes and is not intended for production.  It is intended 
to be a more opinionated way of creating a certificate authority and certificates from 
that authority for the purposes of simulating real certificates, without having to 
memorize complex openssl commands to do so.
